# Welcome to the Animint Designer Manual web site!

This manual explains how to design and create interactive data
visualizations using the R package `animint`. The chapters of this
manual are organized as follows.

## The animint extensions to the grammar of graphics {#animint}

The first seven chapters should be read sequentially, since they give
a step by step guide to interactive data visualization using
animint.

[Chapter 1](Ch01-motivation.html) gives an overview of data analysis
and visualization. It provides motivation and a theoretical foundation
for the other chapters, and should be especially useful for readers
who are completely new to data analysis. It introduces the method of
data visualization prototyping using sketches, without introducing R
code.

Starting with [chapter 2](Ch02-ggplot2.html), we will show how plot
sketches can be translated into R code. Chapter 2 explains the basics
of plotting using ggplot2 and animint, and should be most useful for
readers who have never used ggplot2. It explains how standard ggplots
can be rendered on web pages using animint.

[Chapter 3](Ch03-showSelected.html) introduces showSelected, one of
the two main keywords that animint introduces for interactive data
visualization design. Chapter 3 begins by explaining selection
variables, which provide the mechanism of interaction in
animint. Chapter 3 then explains how the showSelected keyword makes it
possible to plot data subsets. Chapter 3 also explains how to use
smooth transitions and animation.

[Chapter 4](Ch04-clickSelects.html) introduces clickSelects, the other
main keyword that animint introduces for interactive data
visualization design. The clickSelects keyword makes it possible for
the user to change a selection variable by directly clicking on a plot
element.

[Chapter 5](Ch05-sharing.html) explains several different ways to
share your interactive data visualizations on the web.

[Chapter 6](Ch06-other.html) covers some other features of animint,
including how to specify hyperlinks, tooltips, data-driven selector
variable names.

[Chapter 7](Ch07-limitations.html) covers the limitations of the
current implementation of the animint R package, and explains
workarounds for some common issues. It also includes some ideas for
improvements, for those who would like to contribute to animint.

## Examples {#examples}

The remaining chapters can be read in any order, since each
chapter explains how to make data visualizations for a particular data
set. 

Chapter 8 explains how to create a multi-panel interactive World Bank
data visualization.

Chapter 9 shows a visualization of data from cyclists in Montreal.

[Chapter 10](Ch10-nearest-neighbors.html) explains how to create an
interactive re-design of the nearest neighbors data visualization from
the Elements of Statistical Learning book by Hastie et al.

Chapter 11 shows a data visualization that explains the Lasso, a
machine learning model for regularized regression.

Chapter 12 shows a data visualization that explains support vector
machines (SVM), a machine learning model for binary classification.

[Chapter 13](Ch13-poisson-regression.html) explains how to create an
interactive visualization that explains the Poisson regression model.

[Chapter 14](Ch14-PeakSegJoint.html) explains how to use the
`.variable` and `.value` aesthetics to create an interactive
visualization of a peak detection model.

## Appendix {#appendix}

[The appendix](ChXX-appendix.html) contains detailed explanations of
several R code idioms that are used throughout this manual.
