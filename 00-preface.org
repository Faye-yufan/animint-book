Preface

The chapters of this book are organized as follows.

Chapters 1-2 introduce data visualization using the grammar of
graphics, as implemented in the ggplot2 R package. They should be
especially useful for readers who are completely new to data analysis,
and readers who have never used ggplot2.

Chapters 3-4 cover clickSelects and showSelected, the main new
keywords that animint introduces for interactive data visualization
design.

Chapter 5-6 covers some other features of animint, including how to
share your interactive data visualizations on the web.

Chapter 7 covers the limitations of the animint R package, and
explains workarounds for some common issues.

Chapters 8-XX each explain in detail how to create an informative
visualization for a particular data set.
