# Chapter 7, Limitations of animint, and workarounds

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path="Ch07-figures/")
```

This chapter explains several known limitations of animint for some
interactive data visualization tasks. It also explains some
workarounds that you can use in these situations. After reading this
chapter, you will understand how to 

* Use shiny to interactively change the aesthetic mapping of an
  animint.
* Use a normalized variable when different `showSelected` subsets have
  very different values of a variable you want to display.
* Compute statistics for each `showSelected` subset, rather than
  relying on the `stat_` functions in `ggplot2`.
* Add data one at a time to a multiple selection variable set, rather
  than using a rectangular selection brush.
* Avoid using `vjust` and some `theme` options.
