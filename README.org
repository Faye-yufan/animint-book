** TODOs

- setup travis?
- what to do about slow loading? split Rmd files so that there is only
  one animint in each? or recode the renderer so that it only loads
  when you scroll down and the animint div becomes visible?
- use http://rstudio.github.io/tufte/ or https://bookdown.org/ ?
- https://bitpay.com for accepting donations? or just create a bitcoin wallet?

** Overview

animint: a grammar for animated and interactive data visualization

- Ch 1, Motivation
  - big, complex data sets. 
    - big => interactive (too many subsets to show at once)
    - complex => multi-layer (data, labels, model, and errors)
  - understanding, communicating, teaching.
  - limitation of ggplot2: link between plots unclear, too many
    details to show at once.
  - limitation of d3: no high-level grammar for describing plots and
    interactions.
- Ch 2, static data visualization with ggplot2
  - Sketching: plot idea => sketch => code
  - why grammar of graphics? multi-layer, multi-panel graphics easy.
  - why multi-layer? anything more complicated than basic plots.
  - why multi-panel? aligned axes or data subsets. motivation for
    animint: what if there are too many subsets than you would like to
    display at once?
  - limitation: summarizing data rather than showing details.
  - e.g. one frame of WorldBank-facets data viz.
  - e.g. WorldBank data facet(year).
  - e.g. change-point data viz + facet(segments ~ profile).
- Ch 3, the showSelected keyword
  - animation package examples?
  - time option
  - duration option
  - WorldBank scatterplot example (point + year text), how to
    emphasize different countries?
  - change-point data viz, how to show different samples? facets?
    model selection curves?
- Ch 4, the clickSelects keyword
  - WorldBank scatterplot with time series.
- Ch 5, sharing animints
  - animint2dir
  - any web server
  - animint2gist
  - rmarkdown
  - github pages
- Ch 6, other features
  - review: aes(key), selector.types, first, duration, time.
  - scale_size_animint
  - chunk_vars
  - aes(href)
  - aes(tooltip)
  - aes(id)
  - selectize option
  - theme_animint height width
  - .variable and .value aesthetics
- Ch 7, limitations of animint
  - shiny. WorldBank-facets, changing aesthetic mappings.
  - updating axes. workaround: normalize data to a common scale.
  - brush / lasso. workaround: click individual data points.
  - ggplot2 stats/positions/exotic geoms. compute it yourself.
  - ggplot2 theme options.
  - vjust!
- Ch 8, the WorldBank-facets example
- Ch 9, montreal bike data?
- Ch 10, knn example
- Ch 11, lasso example
- Ch 12, SVM example
- Ch 13, Poisson regression
- Ch 14, PSJ
