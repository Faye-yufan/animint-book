** TODOs

- setup travis
- convert to Rmd with one animint (otherwise loading probably too
  slow).
- use http://rstudio.github.io/tufte/ ?

** Overview

animint: a grammar for animated and interactive data visualization

- Ch 1, Motivation
  - big, complex data sets. 
    - big => interactive (too many subsets to show at once)
    - complex => multi-layer (data, labels, model, and errors)
  - understanding, communicating, teaching.
  - limitation of ggplot2: link between plots unclear, too many
    details to show at once.
  - limitation of d3: no high-level grammar for describing plots and
    interactions.
- Ch 2, static data visualization with ggplot2
  - Sketching: plot idea => sketch => code
  - why grammar of graphics? multi-layer, multi-panel graphics easy.
  - why multi-layer? anything more complicated than basic plots.
  - why multi-panel? aligned axes or data subsets. motivation for
    animint: what if there are too many subsets than you would like to
    display at once?
  - limitation: summarizing data rather than showing details.
  - e.g. one frame of WorldBank-facets data viz.
  - e.g. WorldBank data facet(year).
  - e.g. change-point data viz + facet(segments ~ profile).
- Ch 3, the showSelected keyword
  - animation package examples?
  - time option
  - duration option
  - WorldBank scatterplot example (point + year text), how to
    emphasize different countries?
  - change-point data viz, how to show different samples? facets?
    model selection curves?
- Ch 4, the clickSelects keyword
  - WorldBank scatterplot with time series.
- Ch 5, sharing animints
  - animint2dir
  - any web server
  - animint2gist
  - rmarkdown
  - github pages
- Ch 6, other features
  - review: aes(key), selector.types, first, duration, time.
  - scale_size_animint
  - chunk_vars
  - aes(href)
  - aes(tooltip)
  - aes(id)
  - selectize option
  - theme_animint height width
  - .variable and .value aesthetics
- Ch 7, limitations of animint
  - shiny. WorldBank-facets, changing aesthetic mappings.
  - updating axes. workaround: normalize data to a common scale.
  - brush / lasso. workaround: click individual data points.
  - ggplot2 stats/positions/exotic geoms. compute it yourself.
  - ggplot2 theme options.
- Ch 8, the WorldBank-facets example
- Ch 9, montreal bike data?
- Ch 10, knn example
- Ch 11, lasso example
- Ch 12, SVM example
- Ch 13, Poisson regression
- Ch 14, PSJ
