animint: a grammar for animated and interactive data visualization

- Ch 1, why animint?
  - big, complex data sets. 
    - big => interactive (too many subsets to show at once)
    - complex => multi-layer (data, labels, model, and errors)
  - Sketching: plot idea => sketch => code
  - understanding, communicating, teaching.
  - limitation of ggplot2: link between plots unclear, too many
    details to show at once.
  - limitation of d3: no high-level grammar for describing plots and
    interactions.
- Ch 2, static data visualization with ggplot2
  - why grammar of graphics? multi-layer, multi-panel graphics easy.
  - why multi-layer? anything more complicated than basic plots.
  - why multi-panel? aligned axes or data subsets. motivation for
    animint: what if there are too many subsets than you would like to
    display at once?
  - limitation: summarizing data rather than showing details.
  - e.g. one frame of WorldBank-facets data viz.
  - e.g. WorldBank data facet(year).
  - e.g. change-point data viz + facet(segments ~ profile).
  - e.g. montreal bike data?
  - e.g. ESL data examples (knn, lasso).
- Ch 3, the showSelected keyword
  - animation package examples?
  - time option
  - duration option
  - WorldBank scatterplot example (point + year text), how to
    emphasize different countries?
  - change-point data viz, how to show different samples? facets?
    model selection curves?
- Ch 4, the clickSelects keyword
  - WorldBank scatterplot with time series.
- Ch X, other features
  - aes(href)
  - aes(tooltip)
  - .variable and .value aesthetics
- Ch X, sharing animints
  - any web server
  - gist
  - rmarkdown
  - github pages
- Ch X, limitations of animint
  - shiny. WorldBank-facets, changing aesthetic mappings.
  - dc+crossfilter. axes, facets, data updated after clickSelects.
